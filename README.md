## ✨ Featured Projects
### [Quizia](https://quizia-lac.vercel.app/)
- **Inspiration:**
-  The idea for Adaptive Quiz stemmed from the desire to create a personalized learning experience. Observing that many users struggle with specific topics, I wanted to develop a system that dynamically adapts to their needs. The goal was to provide a more targeted approach to quiz-based learning, helping users focus on their weaknesses and improve efficiently.
- **What It Does:**
- Adaptive Quiz starts with introductory questions to gauge user knowledge. It collects topic tags from incorrect answers and then uses this information to suggest subsequent questions based on the most frequent topic tags. Additionally, the integrated chatbot provides hints and necessary resources to help users improve their understanding of the topics.
